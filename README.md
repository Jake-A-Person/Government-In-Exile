## Completed Features

### Core features
A Journal Entry (JE) that fires when a non-communist recognized or unrecognized major or great power has a communist revolution. This JE will fail if their war support drops below -75. When this happens an Event fires.

This event gives the player an option for which one of their subjects to flee too or to flee to their directly owned overseas territory (i.e. Corsica).

Once they arrive to their new nation, they annex all overseas territory (i.e. if fleeing France, they would annex all their territory in Africa assuming no direct land connection).
There is a Journal Entry that allows the exiled government to return to their home nation (the nation they were exiled from) via war.

### Flavour

If the nation they flee to is a minority ruled nation not including not east India or east Indies i.e. East Africa they get an event where they can choose if they want reform the nation eventually giving rights to natives and the other option is to supress the natives.

If they chose to reform, they get a JE chain to reform the nation. If they chose to supress then they get a JE to help them replace the local culture with their own.

If the nation they flee to is East India (British East India Company or Raj) or east Indies (Duch East Indies modern day Indonesia) they can chose to form the dominion of India or Indonesia, this means they gain the native primary cultures the nations tag changes.

Some custom names and flags for the minority ruled nations if they chose to flee their i.e. if their home nation is France and they flee to East Africa. East Africa will have the name Free France and their flag from WW2, or if their home nation is China, they will have the name Free China and the correct flag for their form of government i.e. republic, monarchy etc.

## Planed Features

1.8.x compatibility

JEs that allow for the exiled government to return via a coup or civil war.

Adding a more in-depth (compared to base game) red scare mechanic which makes nations have worse relations with communist nations and might even intervein to place the government in power.

Adding custom names and flags helped by a python program I am currently writing. I wonâ€™t add them for all nations as it would have too much of a performance impact.

Adding JEs to simulate the stability of minority ruled nations when exiled there.
